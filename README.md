## üåü Project Overview

**Multi-Agent Tutoring System** is a web-based application that simulates a team of specialized AI tutors, each responsible for different subject areas. The system routes user queries to the appropriate agent, providing step-by-step solutions, conceptual explanations, and interactive chat features.

This project is ideal for showcasing professional web development skills, algorithmic thinking, and project management in a portfolio.
